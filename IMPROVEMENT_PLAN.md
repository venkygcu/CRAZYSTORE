# CrazyShop Improvement Plan

## Audit Summary
- **Frontend**: Built with React 18.2.0 using Create React App and a mix of static and dynamic assets. Route protection relies on localStorage tokens checked client-side only.
- **Backend**: Express server with SQLite database, basic JWT authentication, Razorpay payments. Static build served from same server.
- **State Management**: React Context (`ShopContext`) handles product list and cart. Dynamically fetches products from `/api/v1/products` with fallback to bundled static data.
- **Payments**: Razorpay integration triggered from frontend, storing orders in SQLite.
- **Documentation**: Extensive README, status, and completion report documents exist, but content may not reflect actual implementation features.
- **Testing**: No automated tests provided besides default CRA setup.
- **Deployment**: Config files for multiple platforms and Docker. Actual readiness requires validation.

## Pain Points & Risks
1. **Authentication & Security**
   - Tokens stored in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS.
   - Admin check is hard-coded to a single email.
   - No password policies or email verification.
2. **Product Data & Cart Reliability**
   - Cart state resets when product list refetches.
   - No SKU management or inventory tracking.
3. **API & Backend**
   - Razorpay credentials required; no sandbox fallback.
   - Error handling lacks structured responses.
   - No input validation layer beyond basic checks.
4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - No unit/integration tests. Manual testing only.
   - No CI quality gates beyond build/deploy.
5. **Documentation Accuracy**
   - Completion report claims features (search, pagination, filtering, admin functions) that may not be fully implemented.

## Proposed Roadmap
1. **Authentication Enhancements**
   - Implement refresh tokens and HttpOnly cookies.
   - Add role-based access control with user roles table field.
   - Include email confirmation and password reset flow.
2. **Product & Cart Improvements**
   - Add inventory fields with availability checks.
   - Persist cart server-side for authenticated users.
   - Implement robust search/filter API endpoints.
3. **Checkout & Orders**
   - Validate address capture, order confirmation, and payment webhook handling.
   - Add order history endpoint for users and admins.
4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Set up Jest/React Testing Library coverage for critical components.
   - Add supertest-based API tests with an in-memory SQLite database.
   - Integrate CI pipeline to run tests and linting.
5. **Documentation & Clean-Up**
   - Align docs with actual features; remove placeholder claims.
   - Provide API specification and sequence diagrams.
   - Document environment-specific setup clearly.

## Next Steps
1. **Confirm scope** for modernization: determine priority features, timeline, and constraints.
2. **Stabilize backend**: Add migrations, validation, and structured error handling.
3. **Enhance frontend UX**: Replace inline styles with consistent design system, add loading/skeleton states, and improve form validation.
4. **Implement automated testing**: Begin with smoke tests, progressively cover core flows.
5. **Security review**: Conduct thorough audit once enhancements are in place.
